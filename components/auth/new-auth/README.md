# Secure Authentication System

This directory contains a completely revamped authentication system for the FinanceHub application, designed with security and simplicity in mind.

## Features

- **Email/Password Authentication Only**: Simplified authentication flow without social logins
- **Strong Password Policy**: Enforces secure password requirements
- **Secure Session Handling**: Implements JWT with proper expiration and refresh logic
- **Consistent Authentication Checks**: Both client and server-side protection
- **Improved Error Handling**: Generic error messages to prevent email enumeration
- **Clean Separation of Concerns**: Each component has a single responsibility

## Components

- `auth-types.ts` - Type definitions for the authentication system
- `auth-provider.tsx` - Context provider that manages authentication state
- `auth-guard.tsx` - Component to protect authenticated routes
- `login-form.tsx` - Secure login form component
- `register-form.tsx` - Registration form with strong password validation
- `index.ts` - Exports all authentication components

## Security Improvements

1. **Secure Authentication Method**: Uses `getUser()` as the primary authentication method instead of `getSession()` for better security
2. **Multi-layered Authentication**: Tries multiple secure methods to retrieve user data
3. **Secure Password Storage**: Passwords are securely hashed by Supabase before storage
4. **Protection Against Session Hijacking**: Proper session validation and cleanup
5. **Generic Error Messages**: Prevents information disclosure about registered emails

## Migration from Old Authentication System

A migration script is provided at `scripts/migrate-auth.js` to help transition from the old authentication system to the new one. The script:

1. Backs up existing auth files
2. Copies new auth files to the appropriate locations
3. Provides guidance for updating imports

To run the migration:

```bash
node scripts/migrate-auth.js
```

After migration, update your imports to use the new authentication components:

```typescript
// Old import
import { useAuth } from "@/components/auth/auth-provider";

// New import
import { useAuth } from "@/components/auth";
```

## Manual Integration

If you prefer to manually integrate the new authentication system:

1. Copy the files from this directory to replace their counterparts in the parent directory
2. Update imports in your application to use the new components
3. Test the authentication flow thoroughly

## Implementation Details

This authentication system follows best practices for secure authentication:

- Uses Supabase Auth with email/password authentication
- Implements proper session management with refresh tokens
- Provides consistent error handling and user feedback
- Protects routes at both client and server level
- Prevents common security vulnerabilities like session hijacking and email enumeration
