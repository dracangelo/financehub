# Authentication System (Temporarily Disabled)

This document provides instructions on how to re-enable the authentication system in the application.

## Current Status

Authentication has been temporarily disabled throughout the application. All authentication-related code has been commented out and mock data is being used instead of fetching real data from the database.

## Files Modified

The following files have been modified to disable authentication:

1. `app/(protected)/layout.tsx` - Authentication check removed
2. `app/(auth)/layout.tsx` - Authentication check removed
3. `app/page.tsx` - Redirect logic modified
4. `app/(auth)/login/page.tsx` - Authentication logic commented out
5. `app/(auth)/register/page.tsx` - Authentication logic commented out
6. `app/(auth)/forgot-password/page.tsx` - Authentication logic commented out
7. `app/(auth)/reset-password/page.tsx` - Authentication logic commented out
8. `app/(protected)/dashboard/page.tsx` - Data fetching replaced with mock data
9. Other pages that fetch user-specific data

## New Files Added

1. `components/layout/user-nav-disabled.tsx` - A version of the user navigation without authentication
2. `lib/mock-data.ts` - Mock data to replace database queries

## How to Re-enable Authentication

To re-enable authentication, follow these steps:

1. Restore the authentication checks in layout files:
   - Uncomment the authentication code in `app/(protected)/layout.tsx`
   - Uncomment the authentication code in `app/(auth)/layout.tsx`
   - Restore the original redirect logic in `app/page.tsx`

2. Restore the authentication logic in auth pages:
   - Uncomment the authentication code in all files under `app/(auth)/`
   - Remove the alert notifications about disabled authentication

3. Replace the disabled user navigation:
   - Replace imports of `UserNavDisabled` with the original `UserNav`
   - Remove the `UserNavDisabled` component file

4. Restore data fetching in pages:
   - Replace mock data with actual Supabase queries in all pages
   - Remove imports of mock data from `lib/mock-data.ts`
   - Restore any commented-out data fetching code

5. Test authentication flow:
   - Ensure login, registration, and password reset work correctly
   - Verify that protected routes properly redirect unauthenticated users
   - Check that user-specific data is being fetched correctly

## Notes for Developers

- All authentication-related code is commented with `// AUTHENTICATION TEMPORARILY DISABLED` for easy identification
- The mock data in `lib/mock-data.ts` can be used as a reference for expected data structures
- The Supabase client is still properly configured, just not being used for authentication

Once these steps are completed, the application should have fully functional authentication again.
